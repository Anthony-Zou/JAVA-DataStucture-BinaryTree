###BINARY Search tree(BST)
Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers.

- It is called a binary tree because each tree node has a maximum of two children.
- It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.

The properties that seperate a binary search tree from a regular binary tree is
1. All nodes of the left subtree are less than the root node
2. All nodes of the t=right subtree are more  tahn the root node
3. Both subtrees of each node are also BST
