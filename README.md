What is an Algorithm?
In this tutorial, we will learn what algorithms are with the help of examples.

In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input and produces a desired output. For example,

An algorithm to add two numbers:

    1. Take two number inputs
    
    2. Add numbers using the + operator
    
    3. Display the result
Qualities of Good Algorithms
- Input and output should be defined precisely.
- Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
- Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
- An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.

# What are Data Structures?
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Depending on your requirement and project, it is important to choose the right data structure for your project. For example, if you want to store data sequentially in the memory, then you can go for the Array data structure.
    
    Note: Data structure and data types are slightly different. Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order.

# Types of Data Structure
Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:

- Linear data structure
- Non-linear data structure
Let's learn about each type in detail.
 ## Linear data structures
In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.

However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.

Popular linear data structures are:

### 1. Array Data Structure
   In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type. And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of arrays is determined by the programming language.
### 2. DSA.Stack Data Structure
In stack data structure, elements are stored in the LIFO principle. That is, the last element stored in a stack will be removed first.

It works just like a pile of plates where the last plate kept on the pile will be removed first. 
### 3. DSA.Queue Data Structure
Unlike stack, the queue data structure works in the FIFO principle where first element stored in the queue will be removed first.

It works just like a queue of people in the ticket counter where first person on the queue will get the ticket first. 
### 4. Linked List Data Structure
In linked list data structure, data elements are connected through a series of nodes. And, each DSA.node contains the data items and address to the next DSA.node.
